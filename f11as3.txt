CECS 424 Assignment 3

Create a Ruby hash table with the words from the file f11as4.txt for 
assignment 4. The key in the hash table will be the word and the value will 
be the number of times it occurs in the file. You might create the file with 
File.new. The "each" method will separate the file into words. Use "downcase" 
to make each word lowercase and "delete" to remove non-alphabetic characters. 
Do not include the empty string as a word. If the word is not in the table 
add it with value one, otherwise increment the value by one. Use "sort" to 
sort on the values, not the keys, and display the sorted hash table. Use 
"select" to find the words that occur more than three times.
